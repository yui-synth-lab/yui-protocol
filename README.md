# YUI Protocol

A sophisticated multi-agent AI collaboration system that implements structured dialogue protocols for enhanced problem-solving and decision-making.

## Overview

YUI Protocol is an advanced AI collaboration framework that orchestrates multiple AI agents through a structured 5-stage dialogue process. Each agent has unique personalities, expertise areas, and communication styles, enabling rich, multi-perspective analysis and synthesis of complex problems.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 5 specialized AI agents with distinct personalities and expertise
- **Structured Dialogue Protocol**: 5-stage process ensuring comprehensive analysis
- **Real-time Interaction Logging**: Detailed tracking of all AI interactions and decisions
- **Session Management**: Persistent session storage with full conversation history
- **Modern Web Interface**: React-based UI with real-time updates
- **TypeScript Architecture**: Fully typed codebase for reliability and maintainability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage with Vitest

## Dialogue Stages

### Stage 1: Individual Thought
Each agent independently analyzes the problem from their unique perspective.

### Stage 2: Mutual Reflection
Agents respond to each other's thoughts with specific analysis and constructive criticism.

### Stage 3: Conflict Resolution
Identified conflicts are addressed with practical solutions and compromise strategies.

### Stage 4: Synthesis Attempt
Different perspectives are synthesized into a coherent framework with facilitator selection.

### Stage 5: Output Generation
Final synthesis and output generation by the selected facilitator agent.
